Sync source and build artifacts to a Jump Station for remote debugging

The jump command synchronizes your local worktree source code and build 
artifacts to a remote Jump Station using a mapped drive and RDP workflow.
This is useful when you need to debug firmware on a remote server using 
tools like Intel ITP that require access to source files and build artifacts 
(.map, .cod, etc.).

USAGE:
  bt jump [/source-only] [/clean]

OPTIONS:
  /source-only - Skip build artifacts (ITP debug files), sync source code only
  /clean       - Clear jump station hash cache (forces full sync on next run)

CONFIGURATION:
  The 'jumpstation' local setting must be configured with the destination path:
    <remote-path>
  
  The remote-path is an absolute path on the Jump Station where files will sync.
  
  Example:
    bt config jumpstation "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\GNext"

WORKFLOW:
  1. Run 'bt jump' on your development machine
     - Creates jump_sync.ps1 and jump_sync.zip in repository root
     - Packages modified/uncommitted source files
     - Packages Intel ITP debug files (.map, .cod, .efi, .pdb, etc.)
     - Embeds local git commit ID in the script
  
  2. Connect to Jump Station via RDP (e.g., using Remote Desktop or RDCMan)
  
  3. Execute the PowerShell script from your mapped drive:
     Example: D:\HPE\Dev\ROMS\G12\jump_sync.ps1
     (Replace D: with your mapped drive letter)
  
  4. Script automatically:
     - Fetches latest git commits
     - Checks if remote commit matches local
     - Stashes uncommitted changes (if any)
     - Resets to local commit (if needed)
     - Copies zip file from mapped drive
     - Extracts all files with progress display
     - Cleans up temporary files

BEHAVIOR:
  - Compares local git commit with remote (embedded in script)
  - Only syncs git if commits differ
  - Uses SHA256 hashes to detect file changes (not timestamps)
  - Stores hashes in .bt/jump_hashes.json for incremental sync
  - First sync: all files; subsequent syncs: only files with changed hashes
  - Handles build artifact regeneration correctly (hash-based, not time-based)
  - Jump station writes .bt/jump_last_sync on completion (validates cache)
  - Uses ZIP_STORED (no compression) for fast zip creation
  - Uses 7-Zip for extraction if available (faster with progress)
  - Falls back to PowerShell Expand-Archive if 7-Zip not found
  - Use /clean to clear hash cache when jump station changes

ADVANTAGES OVER SSH APPROACH:
  - No SSH server configuration needed
  - No password authentication complexity
  - No network connectivity issues
  - Uses existing RDP connection and mapped drives
  - Full visibility into sync progress
  - Manual control - you decide when to sync

REQUIREMENTS:
  - RDP access to the Jump Station
  - Local drive mapped on Jump Station (e.g., \\devmachine\D$ → D:)
  - Git installed on Jump Station
  - Optional: 7-Zip on Jump Station (for faster extraction with progress)

EXAMPLES:
  # Configure jump station destination
  bt config jumpstation "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\GNext"

  # Generate sync files (creates jump_sync.ps1 and jump_sync.zip in repo root)
  bt jump

  # Sync source only (skip 18K+ build artifacts)
  bt jump /source-only

  # Clear hash cache (forces full sync next time)
  bt jump /clean

  # On Jump Station via RDP, execute:
  D:\HPE\Dev\ROMS\G12\jump_sync.ps1

NOTE:
  - Sync is one-way only (local → Jump Station)
  - Platform must be set (.bt/platform) to sync build artifacts
  - First sync may take longer; subsequent syncs skip unchanged files
  - Multiple repositories can have different jump station configurations
