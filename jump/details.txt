Sync source and build artifacts to a Jump Station for remote debugging

The jump command synchronizes your local worktree source code and build 
artifacts to a remote Jump Station using robocopy. This is useful when you
need to debug firmware on a remote server using tools like Intel ITP that
require access to source files and build artifacts (.map, .cod, etc.).

USAGE:
  bt jump [/check]

OPTIONS:
  /check - Verify jump station configuration and connectivity without syncing
           - Tests network connectivity to jump station
           - Verifies destination path is accessible with write permissions
           - Counts files that need to be transferred
           - Compares local and remote git commits

CONFIGURATION:
  The 'jumpstation' local setting must be configured first with the format:
    <ip-or-hostname>;<username>;<password>;<remote-path>
  
  The remote-path is a local path on the Jump Station system (e.g., C:\path\to\folder)
  It will be automatically converted to a UNC path (e.g., \\host\C$\path\to\folder)
  
  Example:
    bt config jumpstation "jumpstation.hpe.com;lowell;MyPassword123;C:\Users\lowell\Desktop\GNext"
  
  This will sync to: \\jumpstation.hpe.com\C$\Users\lowell\Desktop\GNext

BEHAVIOR:
  - Syncs all source files from the current worktree
  - Syncs build artifacts for the configured platform (.bt/platform setting)
  - Uses robocopy with incremental sync (only changed files)
  - Excludes: .git/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, and intermediate build files

EXAMPLES:
  # Configure jump station (use caret ^ to escape ! in cmd.exe)
  bt config jumpstation "jumpstation.hpe.com;lowell;Pass123;C:\Users\lowell\Desktop\GNext"

  # Verify configuration before first sync
  bt jump /check

  # Perform the sync
  bt jump

NOTE:
  - Sync is one-way only (local → Jump Station)
  - Requires network connectivity to the Jump Station
  - Large initial sync; subsequent syncs are incremental and much faster
  - Platform must be set (.bt/platform) to sync build artifacts
  - Use /check to validate setup before syncing large amounts of data
