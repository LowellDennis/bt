Sync source and build artifacts to a Jump Station for remote debugging

The jump command synchronizes your local worktree source code and build 
artifacts to a remote Jump Station using robocopy. This is useful when you
need to debug firmware on a remote server using tools like Intel ITP that
require access to source files and build artifacts (.map, .cod, etc.).

USAGE:
  bt jump [destination-path]

PARAMETERS:
  destination-path - Optional Windows network path where files should be synced
                     (e.g., \\jumpstation\share\username\worktree)
                     If not provided, uses the saved 'jumpstation' setting

CONFIGURATION:
  The 'jumpstation' local setting stores connection information in the format:
    <ip-or-hostname>;<username>;<password>;<destination-path>
  
  Example:
    jumpstation.hpe.com;lowell;MyPassword123;\\jumpstation\share\lowell\g12

  Set using: bt config jumpstation <value>

BEHAVIOR:
  - Syncs all source files from the current worktree
  - Syncs build artifacts for the configured platform (.bt/platform setting)
  - Uses robocopy with incremental sync (only changed files)
  - Excludes: .git/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, and intermediate build files
  - First-time use will prompt to save the destination path

EXAMPLES:
  # First time - specify destination and save it
  bt jump \\jumpstation\share\lowell\g12

  # Subsequent syncs - uses saved destination
  bt jump

  # Configure via config command
  bt config jumpstation jumpstation.hpe.com;lowell;Pass123;\\jumpstation\share\lowell\g12

NOTE:
  - Sync is one-way only (local → Jump Station)
  - Requires network connectivity to the Jump Station
  - Large initial sync; subsequent syncs are incremental and much faster
