   /debug:    Force building a debug   build.
   /itp:      Build with TXT_ACM_PRODUCTION=FALSE for Intel ITP debugger support.
              (By default, the local setting for itp controls this.)
   /release:  Force building a release build.
              (By default, the local setting for release controls what is built.)
   /warnings: Turns on reporting of warnings.
              (By default, the local setting for warnings controls this.)

Steps
-----
1. Validate command line arguments.
  a. Error: if command line arguments are invalid!
2. Determine the top directory of the target repository or worktree.
  a. Error: if the top cannot be found!
  b. Error: if the top is not in the list of repositories or worktrees!
3. Gets the local name.
  a. Error: if the local name is not set.
4. Create the build command with the indicated parameters and switches.
  a. Include TXT_ACM_PRODUCTION=FALSE if /itp is present or local itp is on.
  b. Release build if /release is present, or local release is on.
  c. Debug build if /debug is present, or local release is off or unset.
  d. Include warnings if /warnings is present, or local warnings is on.
  e. If /upload is present,
    i.  Error: if the local bmc is not set or is invalid.
    ii. If local bmc indicates iLO, include /I option with bmc IP
    iii. Upload for OpenBMC is TBD
5. Issue the build command, capturing output to 'build.log.'
  a. Filter the screen output so errors and warnings are more visible.
6. Send build completion email alert (if enabled).
